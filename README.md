Minesweeper Rules:
    
    1. A 16 X 16 Grid contains 40 mines hidden throughout
    2. The Player's job is to locate and flag all mines to win
    3. The Player loses if they uncover a mine
    4. The Player wins if the whole board is uncovered and all mines are flagged 
    5. A tile can either be blank, contain a number (1-8), or have a mine
    6. A number indicates how many mines are touching (including diagonally) that square
    7. Clicking a blank space uncovers all surrounding blank spaces (stop at first number)
    8. The button at the top will change to X-eyed emoji if player lost, from a smiley faced emoji
    9. Pressing the button at the top will reset the board and re-randomize placement of mines
    10. Stopwatch at the top will start after the first click and only stops when the player has either won or lost the game
    11. Left click will uncover a tile
    12. Right click will flag a tile (meant only for bombs)
