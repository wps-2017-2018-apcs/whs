# Site

This directory is used by `mvn site` to create the `site` directory of https://wps-2017-2018-apcs.github.io/whs/, which is mirrored in the `docs/` directory of the `whs/` repository.

This folder is compiled using `site.xml` and combined with various Maven reports and the Javadocs for the Minesweeper API into `target/site`.
`target/site` is then committed and pushed to the repository in `whs/docs/`, which is the directory served by https://wps-2017-2018-apcs.github.io/whs/, the `github-pages` server.

It's a bit circular, but the documentation site in `whs/docs/` can be completely updated with these steps:

1. Execute `mvn clean package javadoc:javadoc` to build all the `.jar` files and the Javadocs for the Minesweeper API into `target/site` on the local repository.
1. Execute `mvn site` to combine the Maven site whose source is in `src/site` on the local repository into `target/site` on the local repository, which is then *automatically* committed and pushed to the repository in `whs/docs/`.
1. Execute `git pull origin master` to update the local repository with the newly committed `whs/docs/`.

The bulk of non-automatically-generated documentation for the Minesweeper project should be edited directly in the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site in `whs/docs/`.
The files in `whs/docs/site/` *should not be edited directly*, but only auto-generated by `mvn site`.

That's it!
